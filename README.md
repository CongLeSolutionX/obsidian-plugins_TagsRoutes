## Version 1.1.0 Release Notes

I'm excited to announce the release of Version 1.1.0, which includes several new features and improvements to enhance your experience:

### Major Updates:

1. **Light Theme Added**:
    
    - Introduced a new light theme with a bright background and distinct visual elements, offering an alternative to the dark theme.

2. **Node Color Synchronization with Obsidian**:
    
    - You can now import node colors directly from Obsidian:
        1. Node colors will sync with Obsidian's graph view.
        2. You can switch between different Obsidian themes and:
            - **Apply Theme Colors**: Import the color scheme of the selected theme.
            - **Save Slot**: Save the imported color scheme into a slot for future use.
        3. The saved color schemes can be reused across different modes (light/dark) and themes, as long as the corresponding slot is loaded.

### New Features:

3. **Enhanced Node Interaction**:
    
    - Clicking on frontmatter tags within a note will now focus on the corresponding node in the scene, consistent with other clickable elements.
4. **User-Friendly Tooltip Bar**:
    
    - A new tooltip bar has been added to guide new users on how to navigate and operate the interface. Special thanks to @RealSourceOfficial for his support in this addition.
5. **Node Label Display Toggle**:
    
    - A new toggle in the settings allows you to turn off node label displays. This is particularly useful if there are too many labels cluttering the view or if you don't need to see note labels constantly.
6. **Improved Node Label Interaction**:
    
    - Node labels will no longer respond to mouse clicks, making it easier to interact directly with the nodes.
7. **Settings Box Style Update**:
    
    - The settings box style has been updated to match the current Obsidian theme, ensuring a more cohesive visual experience.

These updates significantly enhance customization options, improve user experience, and provide better integration with Obsidian's theming system. I hope you enjoy the new features and improvements!

## Version 1.0.9/1.0.10 Release Notes:

1. **Support for Named Color Input**: Added support for named color input, making it easier to select the perfect color.
2. **Frontmatter Tags as Individual Tags**: Tags in the frontmatter are now treated as individual tags, separate from the tags in the note content.
3. **File List Report Generation**: You can now generate a report of files associated with a tag by clicking on a frontmatter tag.
4. **Colorful Node Name Display**: Node names now display in color by default, not just when hovered over.
5. **Other Improvements**:
   1. Updated the plugin icon.
   2. Added a new general settings option to toggle whether the graph opens in the current tab.
   3. Introduced a reset color button in the color settings section.

This plugin provides a comprehensive graph view to visualize the relationships between files, file-tag connections, and inter-tag connections within Obsidian. **It is particularly useful for users who manage extensive thoughts and ideas with numerous tags in Obsidian.**

# Features: 
 
- **Node and Link Visualization** :
  - Display all files and their links.
 
  - Display all tags and their connections, including:
    - Tag-to-tag links

    - Tag-to-file links

    - File-to-file links
 
- **Dynamic Node Sizing** :
  - Adjust the size of file nodes based on the number of links.

  - Adjust the size of tag nodes based on their frequency of appearance.

This approach helps you identify the most significant parts of your vault at a glance.

# Additional Functionalities: 
 
- **Orphan File Linking** : 
  - Connect all orphan files, making them easier to review. Note that orphan files are not necessarily useless but are:
    - Non-markdown files with no links to other files.

    - For example, they could be isolated images from copy/paste operations or various collected items.
 
- **Orphan Excalidraw File Linking** :
  - Connect all orphan Excalidraw files that are not linked by any markdown files, simplifying their review.

# Interactive Features: 
 
- **Node Interaction** :
  - Click on a file node to open it in the editor, regardless of its file type.
 
  - Click on a tag node to generate a query result for that tag, displayed in a file in the editor.
    - Provides a clear view of the tag's content by capturing the surrounding lines until a blank line is encountered, showing the entire paragraph containing the tag.
 
- **Graph Focus** :
  - Clicking on any file to open it in the editor will automatically focus the graph on its node.

  - Clicking on a tag in Obsidian's "Reading Mode" will focus on the tag node in the graph.

This allows you to clearly understand the status of files and tags through:

- The fileâ€™s link status

- The tags contained within the file

# Adjustable Settings: 

- Focus distance on a node

- Toggle tag query result page

- Toggle log page
 
- Display styles:
  - Link distance and width
  - Link particle size, number, and color
  - Node size and repulsion


# Install
- Search for "Tags routes" in Obsidian's community plugins browser, or you can find it [HERE](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=tags%20routes).

- You can also install it manually:
